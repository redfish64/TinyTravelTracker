    <h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId8528"></a>Overview</h1>
    <p>Open Travel Tracker keeps track of your GPS location in a
      private, encrypted database able to store and effectively view
      hundreds of thousands of GPS points, which are all stored directly
      on your phone. It has an advanced user interface to see exactly
      when and where you have gone. The data is owned and viewable only
      by you, and can be exported to a standard GPX format to use as you
      wish.</p>
    <p>The GPS tracking can be throttled in order to conserve battery
      life, making it entirely feasible to leave on continually and have
      an automatic electronic journal of everywhere you have gone.<br>

    <p>This screen shows a map of the world along with GPS points
      recorded, as shown in Figure 1.1, below. Any pictures and video

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId454015"></a>Viewing and
      Changing the Time Range</h2>
    <p>After collecting a large number of points, you often will want to
      view a small time range, such as a single day, week, or month. The
      Time Range, shown below in Figure 1.2, is used to do this.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><img alt="" src="fig_1.2.png"><br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
          <td class="figure"> Figure 1.2 The gray area at the bottom
            selects the time being viewed and can be adjusted by sliding
            your finger across it
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The time range can be moved by sliding your finger across the
      panel side to side, or up and down. Sliding side to side will move
      backwards and forwards in time. Dragging up and down will increase
      and decrease the time scale, from months all the way down to
      minutes. If the trail goes off the map, you may have to zoom out
      or adjust the map view. You can also use the Auto Zoom button, <img
        alt="" src="autozoom.png" class="autozoom">, as described <a
        href="#mozTocId711699">here<br>
      </a></p>
    <p> The current time range will be shown in the white text at the
      top of gray panel. This corresponds to the time that falls within
      the H shaped marker in the center. For example in Figure 1.3,
      below, the time range is April through August. <br>
      <br>
    </p>

      The color of the trail corresponds to the colored area in the
      bottom panel. In Figure 1.4, below, the orange color is around May
      29th, and the GPS Trail indicates the user was in Istanbul. The
      green color is June 1st, and the user was near the center of
      Turkey, and the blue color was around June 4th, and the user was
      on the southern shore.<br>

    <p>This option will turn GPS point collection on and off. GPS point
      collection will remain on regardless if the Open Travel Tracker
      app is running or not.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To verify that readings are being taken, look for an icon of a

      (Settings Screen)</h2>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId991029"></a> </h2>
    <p>This option specifies the percentage of time the GPS receiver
      will be used as a percentage. If this value is lowered, battery
      consumption by the GPS system will be reduced, but less points
      will be taken. For example, if this value is set to 10%, then, on
      average, the GPS will be turned on for 1 minute during a 10 minute
      time period.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The actual length of time that GPS will run at time depends on
      the signal strength available. If there is poor or no signal, Tiny
      Travel Tracker will turn on the GPS for longer periods of time
      with greater intervals in between. For example, considering the
      10% setting, if a GPS location isn't found after 15 seconds of
      searching, after 150 seconds, 30 seconds of searching will be
      attempted. Then the phone will wait for 300 seconds before trying
      again with 60 seconds, etc., up to a maximum of 2 minutes of
      search time and 20 minutes of rest.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId24411"></a>Min Battery Life
      (Settings Screen)</h2>
    <p>This option will stop Open Travel Tracker from taking GPS
      readings if the battery life falls below the given percentage.
      This prevents the battery from draining too quickly when it is
      low.<br>

    <h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId126314"></a>Security</h1>
    <p>All GPS data is encrypted and undecipherable outside of the Tiny
      Travel Tracker application. If Open Travel Tracker is uninstalled,
      all GPS point data is deleted from the phone and the private
      encryption key is cleared.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Any backup that is created may be done so with a password using
      the WinZip 256 bit AES standard. If a password is used, then
      encrypted data is written straight to disk without the creation of
      a temporary unencrypted file. For more details, see below.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId916680"></a>Security Details<br>
    </h2>
    <p>All GPS points are encrypted using a combination of AES and RSA.
      In general the encryption length for AES is 256 bits, but this may
      be 128 bits depending on your jurisdiction. (To find the number of
      bits currently being used, select Settings / About within Tiny
      Travel Tracker and scroll to the bottom.) RSA uses 2048 bit
      encryption. For AES, we use CBC with PKCS5 Padding and a random
      initialization vector for each row.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The basic method is to store an encrypted RSA private key and an
      unencrypted RSA public key into private application data (ie.
      Shared Preferences). The public key is used to create an AES
      symmetric key that is then used to encrypt GPS points and related
      information. The reason for the RSA key is to allow the system to
      record and encrypt GPS points without having the password
      available, which would happen if the phone is rebooted, or the
      application is killed. GPS points can still be recorded and
      encrypted when the application is in this state, but not decrypted
      until a password is entered.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The RSA private key is encrypted using the PBKDF2 standard with
      2048 iterations along with a 256 bit salt. If no password is used,
      a default password is chosen and data remains encrypted. The
      password along with the private and public keys are stored as
      internal application preferences and are inaccessible by other
      apps on the system (assuming they don't have root).<br>
    </p>
    <p>The encrypted GPS point data and the encrypted AES private keys
      are stored in external storage and<b> *are* </b>accessible by
      other apps on the system. However, they would need the RSA private
      key and salt which are inaccessible, along with the password in
      order to decrypt them.<br>
